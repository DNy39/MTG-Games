This repository is to share our deck lists with each other
When adding a new deck:
Use a folder to show what mana color it belongs to: such as Black-Red for my Goblins
Then Create a new folder in the mana color folder, and name it the same thing as your deck name: Goblin Insta-swarm
In that folder, there should be 2 files: 1) deck list and 2) deck tips
